Adversial-attacks-and-Defences

1. Investigated adversarial perturbation attacks on Deep Neural Networks using the MNIST digits dataset as a benchmark.
2. Evaluated adversarial retraining as a defense against adversarial perturbations.
3. Implemenent FGSM based untargeted attacks, FGSM based targeted attacks, Adversarial Retraining against Untargeted FGSM Attacks and defenses on the baseline DNN
4. Completed an adversarial attack challenge. Used adversarial attack procedure to implement untargeted attacks on a 2-layer baseline DNN.

# Dataset
The Fashion_MNIST dataset is a commonly used “toy” benchmarks for machine learning. It
contains 28X28 grayscale images with a label from 10 classes, along with the associated
labels. The dataset is available as part of the tensorflow package.
